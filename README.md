# Python Only Web View

WEB VIEW in python with a backend, THIS IS SO COOL.

Use the web_app.py to create your own Web View desktop application you can understand how to do it by reading the code thoroughly, you can also make changes to it and make it better.

Now with this you can use flask (ANY OTHER BACKEND TOO) to communicate with html and js and make powerfull, logical and beautiful (CSS) applications.

Here is a demo screenshot for you to look at:
